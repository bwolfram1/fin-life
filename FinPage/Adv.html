            <h3>What are stocks?</h3>
            <p id="what" class = "lead">Stocks are basically a piece of a company a person can buy. There are two types of stocks. They are perfered and common stock. The average person usually can't buy perfered stocks so I will not talk about them very much. </p>

        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>Why do people buy stocks?</h3>
            <p id="inter" class ="lead">People buy stocks as an investment. Since you own a piece of a company that has a value that stock is worth money. You can sell that stock at anytime and get the value of that stock at that current time. This means, that if the company's worth goes up or down the price of the stock is reflected. A lot of people buy stocks to make an income or to save for their retirement.</p>

            <h3>Can a college student invest in the stock market with a little amount of money?</h3>
            <p id="party" class = "lead">Young people need to start investing as soon as they can. Some stock platforms have no minimum. There platforms are Robinhood and Stash. Both of which I use as a college student. I can't stress how import it is for college students and young people or just adults in general how important it is to start investing. No matter why you are investing but at least start to plan for retirement. Maybe even plan for an early retirement. Stocks are a great way for one to retire and spend the rest of their life traveling the world. You can literally make a trade from anywhere in the world now.</p>

            <p id = "process" class="lead">
                The process is actually pretty straight forward. You must be signed up with a trading platform to be able to actually exicute trades. The hard part is actually picking stocks to invest in. There are a lot of numbers to look at and a lot of people telling you want to do. It may be overwhelming sometimes.

            <h3>What are the metrics that people look for when investing in a company?</h3>
            <p class = "lead">There are many metrics that people look at when they are contimplating buying a stock. Some investors have algothims that go through hundreds. Some of the top 10 most common are Price to Earnings, Price to Book, Debt to Equity, Free Cash Flow, PEG Ratio, Profit Margin, Beta, Dividend Yield, and Dividend Date.</p>
            <h4>Price-to-Earnings Ratio</h4>
            <p>This is the price the investor can expect to invest in order to get a dollar from the company</p>
            <h4>Debt-to-Equity</h4>
            <p>This shows how much debt the company is using in order to fund the companies assets. The lower the better!</p>
            <h4>Free Cash Flow</h4>
            <p>This shows how much money the company can spend without affecting the company.This is a maybe indicatior. Negative cash flow isn't always bad.</p>
            <h4>PEG Ratio</h4>
            <p>This provides a more complete picture and can show us undervalued stock. The lower the better in this too! High could mean overvalued stock and the value will drop very soon.</p>
            <h4>Profit Margin</h4>
            <p>This shows how profitable the company is.</p>
            <h4>Beta</h4>
            <p>This measures how much the stocks moves in relation to the stock market. It's a main indicatior of risk. Close to zero is conservative while 2 or -2 is pretty aggressive</p>

            <h3>What is a Derivative?</h3>

        <div>
            <h3>What are Options?</h3>

            <h3>Who creates these contracts?</h3>
            <p id="time" class = "lead">Most of the time buisnesses create them between other businesses. Futures contracts can also include stocks and other financal assets. In this case, it would only be limited to a business to business transaction.</p>

            <h3>Trading Methods</h3>
            <p id="tradMeth" class = "lead">My personally favorate stock investment trading method is momentium trading as it involves a lot of technical analysis of stocks to see which would be the best to buy or sell right now. This isn't too good for beginners as it involves gaining a lot of knowledge. Some beginners may get discouraged from it. The far best option to start trading stocks right now is to buy index funds. The only difference between an index fund and a regular common stock is that an index fund is a group of stocks lumped into one single stock. The best index fund would likely be the Vanguard 500 Index. This gives you access to a lot of stock with just one buy. With index funds, you just hold on for the ride. It is a pretty easy strategy and perfect for beginners.</p>

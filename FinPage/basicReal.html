        <div>
            <h3>What is a loan?</h3>
            <p id="what" class = "lead">A loan is usually money that is borrowed and the borrower is expected to pay it back. A major factor in a load is the interest rate. Interest is the price that you pay for borrowing money from a lender.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>How is interest calculated?</h3>
            <p id="inter" class ="lead">Interest is usually caluclated by the initial amount times the annual rate times the time the loan is for. To get the annual interes you just leave out the time part as this will calculate the interest for a year.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>Who are the parties invovled in the loan process?</h3>
            <p id="party" class = "lead">The parties invovled in the loan process are the lender and the borrower. The lender is the party that is give the money. The borrower is the person who is borrowing the money from the lender.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What is the loan process?</h3>
            <p id = "process" class="lead">
                The loan process starts then a perspective borrower goes to a lender and ask for a loan. The perspective borrower then fills out an application for the loan. This application is what is what people refer to as 'applying for a loan'. The application gives the lender much needed infomation that allows the lender to get a better outlook on the type of borrower the person is. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>Why does the lender need to see what kind of borrower I am?</h3>
            <p id = "worthy" class = "lead">The lender needs to see what type of borrower the person is to gauge how risky it would be to loan that person money. If the borrower is too risky the lender may require a cosigner. The most important thing the lender looks at is your credit score.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
           <h3>Why does the lender mean by risk?</h3> 
           <p id="risk" class = "lead">Risk is what helps the lender determine interest rate. And, as stated above, it help the lender determine the if the borrower needs to have a cosigner. If the credit score is really bad and no cosigner is available to sign the loan then the lender must deny the person's request for the loan.w</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What is a cosigner? </h3>
            <p id="cosign" class = "lead"> A cosigner is someone who has better credit than the borrower and basically allows the lender to fall back on the cosigner to repay the loan in the event of the initial borrower doesn't pay. This is like most student loans that students get. Often times the student doesn't have enough credit built up so their parents or someone else needs to sign for the loan.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What are the types of Loans?</h3>
            <p id="types" class = "lead">There are many types of loans. The most popular are unsecuried and secured loans. Unsecuried loans are like a loan in the form of a credit card. It is unsecuried because the lender doesn't have any collateral against the loan. The other is a securied loan. This is something like a car loan or mortgage. It is called a securied loan because the lender has collateral in case the person doesn't pay the loan back.</p>
            <p>Loans also come in two different kinds of interest types. One is a fixed-rate loan. This has a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly payment. Another is called a variable-rate loan. These usually has an increasing payment. They are usually only done over a short time.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>Conclusion?</h3>
            <p id="con" class = "lead">Loans can be really useful as they can help build credit or buy a really big ticket idem. Loans can also be really bad. When people borrow too much and can't repay the loan or they borrow too much already knowing that they can't repay the loan. Either is a recipe for disaster. You can avoid this by doing your best to not getting too many loans or if you need to get a loan you must know how much the monthly payments are. You can do this by getting that annual interest rate that you found perviously and dividing it by the numbe of payments in a year. So that would be: Initial amount times interest rate then divided by the number of payments in one year. Also, it would be best to try avoid student loans as much as possible as they tend to have higher interest rates than a lot of other loans. Also, try to pay for college with other means besides student loans because the student loans become a problem later in life.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>What is a mortgage?</h3>
            <p id="mWhat" class = "lead">A mortgage is a type of loan that a person usually gets to finance a house. So, getting a mortgage is similar to getting any other type of loan. The only difference is the time you are expected to pay it back.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What is the time period then?</h3>
            <p id="time" class = "lead">The time period is usually around 30 years. The reason why they are this long is because the person is expect to live in that house for a decently long time. Also, it is due to how much the loan is for. Most of the time the amounts are over a quarter of a million.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>Is there anything that helps the chances of getting approved?</h3>
            <p id="approved1" class = "lead">Of course, having good credit is the first thing. There is actually something called being perapproved for a mortgage. This is where a lender already approves you to get a mortgage at a set value. Just be sure to check the ARP. This is basically the interest rate for the mortgage. It would also to get to know some of the lenders in the mortgage market.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What are some of the lenders on the market?</h3>
            <p id="mLenders" class = "lead">Some type of lenders on the market are credit unions, mortgage banks, local mortgage lenders, and saving banks. The most popular are usually credit unions and mortgage banks. Saving banks are weird in the sense that they are usually chartered by a local government. They are like a mutual fund but for saving. More on mutual funds later</p>

        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
        <h3>What is a 30 year fixed?</h3>
        <p id="30y" class = "lead">A 30 year fixed is a mortgage that is fixed-rate loan and is for a time of 30 years. Depending on the fixed rate it can be really good but you need good credit to get one.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>What is a checking account?</h3>
            <p id="check1" class = "lead">A checking account is the account that you depsoit your checks that you get from working. It is also what you use to pay people and buisnesses for goods and services</p>
        </div>
        <hr class = "dash" style="margin-top: 300px;">
        <div>
            <h3>What should I look for in a good checking account?</h3>
            <p id="check1" class = "lead">Finding a checking account isn't very hard but finding a pretty good checking account is harder. You need to look at the fees that the bank where your checking account is at charges you. The main three are ATM fees, account minimum fees, and overdraft fees. ATM fees usually occur when you withdraw money from an ATM that isn't your own. You get a fee from that bank and maybe even a fee from your bank. Some banks have a fee if your account is lower than a certain amount. This only happens if your account is below a certain amount. This is why it's called minimum fee. Lastly, an overdraft fee is when you accendientally take out more money from your bank than you have in your account. The bank charges you money for this because they lose money when you do this. </p>
